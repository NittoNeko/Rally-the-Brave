## Notice

This is an experimental project, through which I'm training myself for game development, 
getting familar with game programming and preparing myslef for job application.
    
With that said, this project is still in development and the progress is fairly slow
because I'd like to try different coding styles, architecture designs and data structures,
in order to find the most effective way of coding in game development.
