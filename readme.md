## Deprecated Architecture

Why deprecated?
1.  I didn't have a full understanding of Entity Component System and Data Oriented Design.
2.  This architecture isn't taking advantages of OOP nor DOD.
3.  This architecture introduces large-scale resuability but causes small-scale duplicate codes.

## Notice

This is an experimental project, through which I'm training myself for game development, 
getting familar with game programming and preparing myslef for job application.
    
With that said, this project is still in development and the progress is fairly slow
because I'd like to try different coding styles, architecture designs and data structures,
in order to find the most effective way of coding in game development.
