## Deprecated Architecture

Why deprecated?
1.  I didn't have a full understanding of Entity Component System and Data Oriented Design.
2.  This architecture isn't taking advantages of OOP nor DOD.
3.  This architecture introduces large-scale resuability but causes small-scale duplicate codes.
4.  Some features bring more problems than benefits.

## Notice
    
This project is still in development and the progress is fairly slow
because I'd like to try different coding styles, architecture designs and data structures,
in order to find the most effective way of coding in game development.
